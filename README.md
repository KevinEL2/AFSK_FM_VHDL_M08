# AFSK_FM_VHDL_M08
Transmitter (and possibly receiver) with AFSk over FM modulutation (maby frequency hopping later)

stuff mostly works, but index was not yet implemented. Turns out i gotta change quite a bit of stuff at taylors.... reason is: value of index is > 1
(i should probably make it so it doesnt matter/ easy to change but oh well)
